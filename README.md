# topokube
Topological view of your kubernetes cluster.

## What is this?

This is my idea for a potentially useful way to view the details of objects deployed to a target kuberentes cluster to help keep an inventory of what has been deployed, how long it's been there, and the dependencies between deployed objects (hence the usage of the term "topo").

See https://github.com/zpratt/topokube/issues/3 for feature ideas to include in v1.
